Pain Points

-Event Organizers
  * Air gap between registration and software input. Currently there is a registration form that is manually input into NDCA Premier. This makes updates to registration more difficult and can add delays
    -Severity: High
    -Frequency: High
    -Solution: Software can provide an online registration form that feeds directly into the software
    -Priority: High. This is a core feature that needs to be nailed.
  * Manual costume change collision prevention. Organizer is manually viewing competitors lists per event to make sure the same people arent in conflicting events at the same time
    -Severity: Medium
    -Frequency: High
    -Solution: Software can automatically check for costume changes and flag conflicts
    -Priority: High. This is a feature that sets our software apart from others
  * Managing liability forms. Each venue has it's own liability forms and this is apparantly complicated. This may be out of scope for this software.
  * Printer issues.
    -Severity: High
    -Frequency: Medium
    -Solution: Ideally, this software makes printers irrelevant. If not, we need to make sure the software is compatible with a wide range of printers and can handle common issues
    -Priority: Medium. This will need to work as an emergency fallback to export to CSVs and print
  * Loss of internet connection
    -Severity: Critical
    -Frequency: Low
    -Solution: Software needs to be able to run offline and sync when internet is available
    -Priority: High. This is a must have feature, otherwise the software is limited in many venues and is the same as existing solutions.
  * Staff organization. Managing assignments and making sure everything gets done.
    -Severity: Medium
    -Frequency: Medium
    -Solution: Software can help manage staff assignments and send reminders
    -Priority: Low. This is likely out of scope for this software. It could be later added as a modular add on, but is not a core feature

-Staff

-Competitors
  * Delay in results posting. Currently, results are posted manually and can take a long time to be posted online
    -Severity: High
    -Frequency: High
    -Solution: Software can automatically post results online as soon as they are available
    -Priority: High. Of other software options, this is a staple. We need to nail this better than they do.
  * Managing registrations. Keep track of which events you're registered for and any changes to your registration
    -Severity: Medium
    -Frequency: Medium
    -Solution: Software can provide a competitor portal where they can view and manage their registrations
    -Priority: Medium. This is a nice to have feature, but not a core feature
  * Up to date schedules and heat lists. Competitors need to know when and where they are dancing
    -Severity: High
    -Frequency: High
    -Solution: Software can provide real-time updates to schedules and heat lists
    -Priority: High. This is a core feature that needs to be nailed.
  * Post-event results viewing needs to be straightforward and easy to navigate
    -Severity: Medium
    -Frequency: Medium
    -Solution: Software can provide a user-friendly interface for viewing results
    -Priority: High. It is an expectation of the ballroom community that results are publicly viewable.
-Studios
