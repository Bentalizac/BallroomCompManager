# Register Page Refactoring

## Overview
Successfully refactored the register page from directly calling tRPC to using appropriate custom hooks for better separation of concerns and reusability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Custom Hooks (`/client/hooks/useEventRegistration.ts`)

#### `useEventRegistration(competitionId?: string)`
- Manages event registration state and mutations
- Handles profile incomplete errors automatically
- Supports both individual and team registrations
- Provides clean API: `register(eventId, role)` and `createTeamRegistration(params)`

#### `useEventRegistrationCancel(competitionId?: string)`
- Manages cancellation state and mutations
- Clean API: `cancel(registrationId)`

#### `useUserEventRegistrations(competitionId?: string, enabled?)`
- Fetches user's event registrations with optimized caching
- 1-minute stale time for fresh data

#### `useCompetitionEvents(competitionId?: string, enabled?)`
- Fetches competition events with longer caching
- 5-minute stale time (events change less frequently)

#### `useEventRegistrationManager(competitionId?: string)`
- **Comprehensive hook** that combines all functionality
- Returns all state, actions, and data in one place
- Used by the register page for simplicity

### 2. Updated Register Page

#### Before:
- Direct tRPC calls with `trpc.event.registerForEvent.useMutation()`
- Manual state management with `useState`
- Verbose error handling
- Manual cache invalidation with `refetch()`

#### After:
- Single hook usage: `useEventRegistrationManager(competition?.id)`
- Declarative state access
- Automatic error handling for profile incomplete scenarios
- Automatic cache invalidation
- Cleaner component code

### 3. Key Improvements

#### Code Reduction
- Reduced component from ~200 lines to ~188 lines
- Eliminated 3 `useState` calls
- Eliminated 2 direct tRPC mutation setups
- Eliminated manual `refetch()` calls

#### Better Error Handling
- Profile incomplete errors handled automatically by hooks
- Consistent error message display
- Type-safe error handling (no more `any` types)

#### Enhanced Data Handling
- Updated to work with new paired/team registration schema
- Shows team names in registration summary
- Shows participant counts
- Maps legacy role format automatically

#### Improved User Experience
- Automatic cache invalidation keeps data fresh
- Optimistic updates during registration/cancellation
- Better loading states

## Hook Architecture Benefits

### Reusability
- Hooks can be used in other components (admin pages, team registration, etc.)
- Consistent API across the application

### Testability
- Business logic separated from UI
- Hooks can be tested independently
- Easier to mock in component tests

### Maintainability
- Single source of truth for registration logic
- Changes to registration behavior only need to be made in one place
- Clear separation of concerns

## Usage Examples

### Individual Registration
```typescript
const { register, isRegistering } = useEventRegistrationManager(competitionId);

await register(eventId, 'competitor');
```

### Team Registration
```typescript
const { createTeamRegistration } = useEventRegistrationManager(competitionId);

await createTeamRegistration({
  eventId,
  participants: [
    { userId: user1Id, role: 'lead' },
    { userId: user2Id, role: 'follow' }
  ],
  teamName: 'Team Awesome'
});
```

### Data Access
```typescript
const { 
  events, 
  userRegistrations,
  isLoadingEvents,
  isLoadingRegistrations 
} = useEventRegistrationManager(competitionId);
```

## Backward Compatibility

The system maintains backward compatibility with the old role system:
- `'competitor'` maps to `'member'`
- `'judge'` and `'scrutineer'` map to `'coach'`
- New roles (`'lead'`, `'follow'`, `'coach'`, `'member'`) pass through unchanged

## Next Steps

1. **Apply to Other Pages**: Use similar hooks in admin pages, team management, etc.
2. **Add Team Registration UI**: Create forms for paired/team registration
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Add toast notifications instead of alerts
4. **Optimistic Updates**: Add optimistic updates for better UX
5. **Testing**: Add comprehensive tests for the custom hooks
